## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Requirements

* [PHP](http://www.php.net/) version 5.4 or greater
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) version 5.6 or greater
* The site can run on either [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) or [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) servers
* Windows OS, macOS or linux OS
* A reputable code editor preferrably [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) 
* [npm!](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installation


### Theme Installation

Download and install [Analytica](https://wordpress.org/themes/analytica/) Theme from the WordPress Theme library


```
This is the site's parent theme
```

The next step is cloning the child theme (ngo) from the bitbucket repository

Once the ngo theme is cloned to your local machine, you need to run the *npm install* command (on the child theme's root folder) in order to install node modules.

Once this is done all that's remaining is to run *gulp* command (on the child theme's root folder) and now you're ready to start coding!


### Required Plugins

There are a number of plugins that are required by the website.

* [Kirki Toolkit](https://wordpress.org/plugins/kirki/) Plugin
* [Qazana Page Builder](https://wordpress.org/plugins/qazana/) Plugin 
* ACF pro

**TIP - Some of the plugins are available on the WordPress plugin library, the languages Qazana Integration will be available on github(url-coming soon) or on the Webteam's folder on google drive but the 3  WP Migrate DB plugins are premium so you won't find them in the WordPress plugin library.**

You can find the premium plugins together with their activation keys on the [Webteam's plugin folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_CL_COyteEAwgK9_T7VbVhqGBpW2QFia) on google drive.
